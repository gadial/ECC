\section{Introduction}
An \emph{Elliptic Curve} can be roughly described as the set of solutions of an equation of the form $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ over some field (e.g. $\mathbb{C}, 
\mathbb{R},\mathbb{Q}$ or some finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$). The importance of elliptic curves stems from their rich structure: there is a rather simple
addition law definable on elliptic curves which makes them into an abelian group. Studying the emerging structure of elliptic curves over various fields has been a
major theme in the mathematics of the 20th century, and elliptic curves were connected to many famous problems and results, most notably the proof of Fermat's
last theorem. See~\cite{Ko84} for an introduction to the subject via the solution of a specific problem (the congruent number problem). A more detailed and through
treatment is presented in~\cite{Sil86} which has become the standard text on the subject.

In the late 70's, \emph{Public-Key Cryptography} systems were first publicly described, changing the face of cryptography. Many of the purposed systems, such
as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange system~\cite{Diffie76newdirections} and the ElGamal encryption system~\cite{19480}, were based on arithmetic in the group $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$, but in theory could
be implemented in other groups as well. Groups based on elliptic curves were a good choice because of their well-developed theory and their high variety. In 1985,
both Neal Koblitz~\cite{Ko87} and Victor S. Miller~\cite{Mil85} suggested public key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves.

Our goal in the project has been to implement an efficient public key cryptosystem based on elliptic curves ``from scratch'', relying only on large-number arithmetic
libraries. In particular, we have implemented all the elliptic-curve related calculations, and additional related algorithms.

\section{Elliptic Curves}
Most generally, an elliptic curve $E$ over a field $K$ can be described as the subset of $K\times K$ satisfying the equation $$y^2+a_1xy+a_3y=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6$$ 
for a given $a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6\in K$, along with another special point ``at infinity'' $\mathcal{O}$. An additional demand is that the curve be ``smooth'',
which means that the partial derivatives of the curve has no common zeros. This can be reduced to checking that some invariant value $\Delta$ (the \emph{discriminant} of the curve)
which is calculated from the coefficients is not zero. Because the nature of the field $K$ is highly relevant to the structure of $E$,
it is common to write $E/K$ indicating the curve $E$ (usually given by the equation) is defined over the field $K$.

\subsection{Definition}
\begin{figure}

   \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{ec.png}
   \caption{An elliptic curve (corresponding to the equation $y^2=x^3-6x$)}
\end{figure}

Depending on the characteristic of $K$, the above equation can be simplified. There are three cases to consider:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item When $charK\ne 2,3$ the equation can be simplified to $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ with $a,b\in K$.
  \item When $charK = 2$ and $a_1 \ne 0$, the equation can be simplified to $y^2+xy=x^3+ax^2+b$ with $a,b\in K$. This curve is said to be \emph{non-supersingular}. If $a_1 = 0$, the equation can be simplified to $y^2+cy=x^3+ax+b$ with $a,b,c\in K$. This curve is said to be \emph{supersingular}.
  \item When $charK = 3$ and $a_1^2\ne -a_2$, the equation can be simplified to $y^2=x^3+ax^2+b$ with $a,b\in K$. This curve is said to be \emph{non-supersingular}. If $a_1^2=-a_2$, the equation can be simplified to $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ with $a,b\in K$. This curve is said to be \emph{supersingular}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Motivating Example: $K=\mathbb{C}$}
A \emph{lattice} in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ is a set of the form $L=\{n\omega_1+m\omega_2|n,m\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ such that $\omega_1,\omega_2\in\mathbb{C}$ are
not colinear. Lattices can be used to generalize the notion of ``periodic function'' to the complex plane: A meromorphic function $f$ is called \emph{elliptic} with respect to the lattice
$L$ if $f(z+l)=f(z)$ for all $l\in L$ (equivalently, $f(z+\omega_1)=f(z+\omega_2)=f(z)$). Thus it suffices to know the values of $f$ of the \emph{fundamental parallelogram} $\Pi=\{a\omega_1+b\omega_2|a,b\in[0,1]\}$
in order to know its values on the complex plane.

In $\mathbb{R}$, the periodic function $\sin(x)$ is ``special'' in the sense that along with its derivative, $\cos(x)$. it can be used to represent all
the periodic functions (via Fourier series). There is a parallel ``special'' function for elliptic functions, which in some regards is ``even better'' than its real counterpart. 
Given a lattice $L$, the \emph{Weierstrass $\wp$-function} for this lattice is defined as $$\wp(z)=\frac{1}{z^2}\sum_{0\ne l\in L}\left(\frac{1}{(z-l)^2}-\frac{1}{l^2}\right)$$
$\wp$ has the property that every elliptic function (in respect to a given lattice $L$) can be written as a \emph{rational} function in $\wp$ and $\wp'$ (as opposed to the
infinite sum of $\sin$ and $\cos$). Thus $\wp$ is the most significant example of an elliptic function.

Let $E/\mathbb{C}$ be an elliptic curve given by $y^2=x^3+ax+b$. A lattice $L$ can be found such that the corresponding Weierstrass function satisfies the differential equation
$(\wp')^2=\wp^3+a\wp+b$. This means that the map $z\mapsto (\wp(z),\wp'(z))$ maps $\mathbb{C}$ to points on the elliptic curve. In particular, $\wp$
has a pole in each lattice point and so $0\mapsto \mathcal{O}$ (this can be made precise by using projective coordinates). Moreover, it
can be shown that this map is onto, and that $z_1,z_2$ give the same point on the curve if and only if $z_1-z_2\in L$, and so we have a bijection
between $E$  and $\mathbb{C}/L$, the latter set can be thought of as a torus (since $\mathbb{C}/L$ is isomorphic to $\Pi$ where parallel edges are ``glued`` together).

Since $\mathbb{C}/L$ can be equipped with an operation of addition modulo $L$, it forms an abelian group. This group structure can thus be induced on the 
isomorphic elliptic curve: Given $P_1, P_2$ on the curve that emerge from $z_1,z_2$ (i.e. $P_i=(\wp(z_i),\wp'(z_i))$) we define $P_1+P_2=(\wp(z_1+z_2),\wp'(z_1+z_2))$ 
(with the addition of $z_1+z_2$ done modulo $L$). This shown that every elliptic curve over $\mathbb{C}$ is an abelian group.
\subsection{The Group Operation}
\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{ecaddition.png}
   \caption{The group operation (\cite{maurerscript})}
\end{figure}
In the previous section we have seen how elliptic curves over $\mathbb{C}$ can be naturally induced with a group operation. There is no similar theory over
other fields, but we can still axiomatically define an operation similar to the one arising in the complex case. A detailed analysis of the complex case yields
the following rough description of the group operation:

First, for the special point $\mathcal{O}$ we have $P+\mathcal{O}=\mathcal{O}+P=P$, so $\mathcal{O}$ is the identity element.

Second, $(x,y)+(x,-y)=\mathcal{O}$ (note that if $(x,y)\in E$ so is $(x,-y)$ since the in equation defining $E$ is of the form $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ and so for
every $x$ we have two possible values of $y$, given that $x^3+ax+b$ has roots at all). So given a point $P$, its additive inverse $-P$ is simply the same point
with the sign of the y-coordinate flipped.

Third, for every three colinear points on the curve $P,Q,R$ we have $P+Q+R=0$, and so $P+Q=-R$. We can picture this in the following manner: Given $P,Q$,
to compute their sum draw a line passing through them, and find the third point where the line crosses the curve (there is always such one - if it seems the line 
''misses`` the curve, it actually intersects it in $\mathcal{O}$; again, using projective coordinates this can be made precise). After such a point was found, we
take its inverse to be the result of $P+Q$. This might seem like an arbitrary definition, and so it is worthwhile to remember that it is actually a result of the non-arbitrary
operation induced in $\mathbb{C}$.

We also need to describe what is $P+P$. In this case we cannot pass a single line ''between $P$ and itself``, but we have a similar notion: Since the curve is smooth,
it has exactly one tangent line in each point. Therefore we have that $P+P$ is the additive inverse of the point of intersection with the curve of the tangent line to the curve at $P$.

This completes the description of the group operation. Although it arises from the complex case, this description is valid over any field, and can be taken to be
the definition of the group action. In is a straightforward technical manner to check that the axioms for group operation are indeed satisfied by this operation.

The geometrical description of the operation is insightful but of little use in algebraic calculations. However, straightforward analytic geometry
gives simple equations for calculating addition of points. The actual equations depends on the simplified form of the curve; we will focus later on the cases
where $charK\ne 2,3$ and $charK=2$ as these are the main cases used in practice.

\subsection{Group Structure}
The structure of the group of an elliptic curve highly depends on the underlying field. For $K=\mathbb{C}$ we have already seen that it has the structure of a torus.
Over $\mathbb{Q}$, a famous theorem of Mordell shows that the group is finitely generated; since it is also abelian, it is of the form $\mathbb{Z}^r\times Z$
where $Z$ (the \emph{torsion} subgroup of the curve) is a finite abelian group. The torsion of an elliptic curve is easy to compute and is very well known -
it is known that there are only 15 possible torsion subgroups, the largest of whom of cardinality 16. The main difficulty is computing the parameter
$r$ - the \emph{rank} of the curve. Of the the most famous open conjectures in mathematics, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, deals
with the connection between the rank of a curve (and various other related parameters) and the behavior of a special function related to the curve (the
zeta-function of that curve).

Over a finite field $K=\mathbb{F}_q$ ($q$ a power of a prime), the order of the curve is, of course, finite. However, it is not easy to know in general
what is the exact number of points on the curve.  A reasonable estimate is given by Hasse's theorem, which shows that the order is roughly $q+1$, with
a square-root bound on the error. More precisely, if $\#E(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the number of points on the curve $E$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, then 
$|\#E(\mathbb{F}_q)-(q+1)|\le 2\sqrt{q}$

Knowing the order of the curve is very important when using curves for cryptographic purposes. There exist algorithms for computing the order, but
they are quite complicated and not very efficient. Thus, sometimes a different approach is used - first the order is chosen, and then a suitable curve
for that order is generated. We elaborate on this later.
\section{Elliptic Curve Arithmetic}
\subsection{Projective Coordinates}
\label{Projective Coordinates}
As we shall see, the usual usage of elliptic curve in cryptosystems is in computing $P+P+\dots+P$ for a given point $P$. 
The formulas for adding points on the curve includes a division operation, which in most implementations is very costly. Therefore, it is reasonable to
transform the coordinate system into one in which no division is needed for the addition operation itself, only for transforming back to the standard
coordinate system once the calculation is complete. Such a coordinate system is the \emph{projective} coordinate system.

Theoretically it is possible to imagine the projective coordinate system as one in which every two-dimensional point is represented by a ray in the three
dimensional space. Formally we consider the set $K^3\\\{(0,0,0)\}$ with an equivalence relation characterized by two positive integers $c,d$ and
defined by $(X_1,Y_1,Z_1)\sim (X_2,Y_2,Z_2)$ if $X_1=\lambda^cX_2,Y_1=\lambda^dY_2,Z_1=\lambda Z_2$ for some $\lambda\in K^*$ (for $c=d=1$
indeed we have that each equivalence class is a line in $K^3$).

The two-dimensional point $(X,Y)$ can be identified with the projective point represented by $(X,Y,1)$, and so in general a projective point represented by
$(X,Y,Z)$ with $Z\ne 0$ corresponds to a standard point $(\frac{X}{Z^a},\frac{Y}{Z^b})$. However, projective points represented by $(X,Y,0)$
have no standard two-dimensional equivalent, and so are considered ''points in infinity``. Indeed, this is a way to formally represent $\mathcal{O}$.

\subsection{Addition Formulas - The Prime Field Case}
We consider now the case $K=\mathbb{F}_p$ for $p>3$ prime (however, for any $K$ such that $char K\ne 2,3$ our description is essentially the same).
In this case let $E$ be a curve defined by $y^2=x^3+ax+b$. Given two points on the curve $P=(x_1,y_1),Q=(x_2,y_2)$ we first consider the case $x_1\ne x_2$
(and so $P\ne\pm Q$). The line passing both in $P$ and $Q$ has slope $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ and so its equation is $y=y_1+\left(\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\right)(x-x_1)$.


Substituting $y$ into the curve's equation yields a complicated equation of degree 3 in $x$; however, since we already know of two roots to the equation $x_1,x_2$
we can find the third one $x_3$ by using the fact that $-(x_1+x_2+x_3)$ equals the coefficient of $x^2$ in the equation, which is exactly the square of the slope, $\left(\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\right)$ 
Hence we have $$x_3=\left(\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\right)^2-x_1-x_2$$

Given $x_3$, finding $y_3$ is easy, and we see that $$y_3=\left(\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\right)(x_1-x_3)-y_1$$

When adding a point $P=(x_1,y_1)$ to itself the only difference is the calculation of the slope, which in this case is the tangent to the curve at $x_1$, hence
the implicit derivative $\frac{3x_1^2+a}{2y_1}$. This yields the equations 

$$x_3=\left(\frac{3x_1^2+a}{2y_1}\right)^2-x_1-x_2$$

and

$$y_3=\left(\frac{3x_1^2+a}{2y_1}\right)(x_1-x_3)-y_1$$

\subsection{Addition Formulas - The Binary Field Case}
In the binary case $K=\mathbb{F}_2$, the curve $E$ is defined by $y^2+xy=x^3+ax^2+b$. First note that the negative of a point $S=(x,y)$ is defined as $-S=(x,x+y)$, and it can be checked that the point $-P$ indeed lies on $E$.
For two points $P=(x_1,y_1),Q=(x_2,y_2)$ (denote $P+Q=(x_3,y_3)$), the easiest cases are $P=\infty$ or $Q=\infty$. By the group law, it holds that $P+\infty=P$ and $\infty+Q=Q$. In the case of $P=-Q$, the result is $P+Q=\infty$.

The remaining two cases are $P=Q$ and $P\ne Q$.

If $P=Q$, we need to double the coordinate, where $\lambda=x_1+\frac{y1}{x1}$ is the slope of the tangent, analogue to the prime case. As resulting x-coordinate one gets $x_3=a+\lambda^2+\lambda$.

If $P\ne Q$, the slope of the connecting line is $\frac{y_1+y_2}{x_1+x_2}$ (note that addition and subtraction are the same in binary field arithmetic). It holds that $x_3=a+\lambda^2+\lambda+x_2+x_1$ (in the case $P=Q$, $x_2+x_1=x_1+x_1=0$).

Finally in both cases the y-coordinate is computed as $y_3=(x_2+x_3)\lambda+x_3+y_2$. The overall algorithm derived from the formula requires 3 multiplications (one is squaring), one multiplicative field inversion, and 9 (or 6 in case of doubling) additions. While the additions are very cheap operations, computing the inverse could be avoided by using projective coordinates as described in \ref{Projective Coordinates}.

\subsection{Point Multiplication}
Scalar point multiplication is a frequently used operation in the cryptosystem we implemented and it is of big importance to implement this efficiently. We want to compute $kP=Q$ for a scalar $k$ and a point $P$. Using only addition, one could compute this as $\underbrace{P+...+P}_{k}$, with a complexity of $O(k)$. A better way is to use the additive equivalent of the \emph{square-and-multiply} algorithm. There, $k$ is processed bit-wise. In each iteration, the result is doubled, and if the bit equals one, $P$ is added. Let $[k_{\log{k}},...,k_1]$ be the bit-representation of $k$, with $k_1$ as the least significant bit:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item $Q=\infty$
 \item for $i=1..\log{k}$:
 \item $Q=Q+Q$
 \item if $k_i=1$: $Q=Q+P$
\end{enumerate}

The complexity of this algorithm is $O(\log{k})$. There are some optimizations to this algorithm, most notably the replacement of the binary representation of $k$ with its \emph{non-adjacent form} which results in a shorter representation. 

\subsection{Binary Field Arithmetic}
The arithmetic in prime fields $\mathbb{F}_p$ is basically well-now; addition and multiplication correspond to integer arithmetic modulo $p$. Finding the inverse can be done using the extended euclidean algorithm. Those operations are provided in the big integer library GMP we used.

In the binary extension field $\mathbb{F}_{2^d}\cong \mathbb{F}_2(\theta)/m(\theta)$, the arithmetic is slightly different and we decided to implement it from scratch. One could alternatively use a library like \emph{NTL}.

Elements of the binary field are actually polynomials of degree $d$ with binary coefficients. And all operations in the polynomial basis are done modulo the reduction polynomial $m(\theta)$. For example the polynomial $\theta^4+\theta+1$ can be displayed as the bit-string $10011$. There is also a normal basis field representation which we will not treat because the more inefficient behavior of its arithmetic.

\paragraph{Addition/Subtraction}
Addition is the simplest operation and is computed as bit-wise XOR: for $a,b\in \mathbb{F}_{2^d}$, $a+b=a\oplus b$.
\paragraph{Multiplication}
Multiplication of two elements $a$ and $b$ has always to be done modulo $m$. Lopez and Dahab \cite{715867} present some efficient algorithms for this case. We implemented one which reminds of the square-and-multiply algorithm and could be called ''shift-and-add`` algorithm ($a$ is represented as $a_l,...,a_1$ and $b$ as $b_l,...,b_1$, let the result be $c$):
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $c=0$
 \item for $i=l,...,1$:
 \item shift $c$ one to the left ($c=c<<1$)
 \item if $a_i=1$: $c=c+b$;
 \item if the degree of $c$ exceeds $d$: $c=c+m$
\end{enumerate}
We note that in each iteration, $c$'s degree could be at most one degree to high, it can therefore be reduced by $m$ by just adding $m$ to $c$.

\paragraph{Inverse}
As we know the extended euclidean algorithm can be used to compute the multiplicative inverse in a finite field. This is also the case in binary fields. Suppose we want to compute the inverse of $a$ modulo the reduction polynomial $m$. We have $aa^{-1}\equiv_m 1$, reforming this we get $aa^{-1}-1=mx$ for a positive $x$. This can be reformed to $aa^{-1}-mx=1$, which is is exactly the setup for the euclidean algorithm, since $gcd(a,-m)=1$, the algorithm can run on the inputs $a$ and $-m$ and delivers as one output $a^{-1}$.

\paragraph{Quadratic Equations}
\label{binquadeq}
A frequent task is the computation of a y-coordinate for a given x-coordinate. Reviewing the equation $y^2+xy=x^3+ax^2+b$, the problem is for given $x$ reduced to a quadratic equation $y^2+a'y-b'=0$, that has either two or no solution. The solutions of this equation equation is equivalent to the solution of $y^2+y=c'$, with $c'=\frac{b'}{a'^2}$.

The procedure to solve this equations is described in IEEE P1363/D13 \cite{point-decompress}, and works as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Choose a random $\rho\in\mathbb{F}_{2^d}$
 \item Initialize $z=0,w=\rho$
 \item Repeat the following two steps $d-1$ times:
 \item $z=z^2+w^2c'$
 \item $w=w^2+\rho$
 \item if $w=0$: start over at point 1. Else output $z$.
\end{enumerate}

This algorithm only works with odd degrees, which is sufficient for our purposes since it is a security requirement for binary field cryptography to choose $d$ as a prime.

\section{Cryptosystem}
To form a cryptosystem, generally a set of three algorithms is required:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Key-generation: An algorithm for generating an encryption/decryption key.
 \item Encryption: An algorithm for encrypting plaintexts.
 \item Decryption: An algorithm for decrypting ciphertexts.
\end{enumerate}
In traditional \emph{symmetric} or \emph{private-key} cryptography, the generated key is used for both encryption and decryption, with the consequence that anybody that possesses the key is able to en- and decrypt messages. To ensure confidentiality, the key has to be kept secret between communication partners.

There was originally no way to establish a secret key over insecure channels (for example internet, using the http protocol). So to establish a shared secret key, a secret channel (which isn't eavesdropped) would be necessary.

The situation changed thanks to public-key cryptography. Its origin lies in the Diffie-Hellman \cite{Diffie76newdirections} protocol, a method to generate a shared secret key between two communication partners over an insecure but authenticated channel. From it, the \emph{ElGamal} cryptosystem \cite{19480} was derived. In such an \emph{asymmetric} system, two separate keys are generated for encryption and decryption. This enables one to publish the \emph{public-key}, with which anyone can encrypt messages, while the \emph{private-key} for decryption is kept secret. Besides encryption schemes, also \emph{signature} schemes exist, with the goal to ensure authenticity of a message instead of confidentiality. There, the private-key is used to \emph{sign} a message, while the public-key is used to \emph{verify} the signature.

We will first discuss some security issues, then we present the cryptosystem we implemented for the project - Elliptic Curve ElGamal. Finally we will treat the issue how to represent messages as points on elliptic curves.

\subsection{Security}
The security of Diffie-Hellman and ElGamal relies on the hardness of the \emph{discrete logarithm}, which is the analogue of the ordinary logarithm, but in a finite cyclic group. The group traditionally used in public-key cryptography is $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$, where the best known algorithm for computing the discrete logarithm is the \emph{index calculus method}.

\emph{RSA} (\cite{Rivest78amethod}), another famous cryptosystem relies on the hardness of \emph{factoring} large numbers.

Both RSA and ElGamal can be adapted for elliptic curves, where the respective variants are called the elliptic curve analogues. Elliptic curve RSA analogues don't provide significant better security since the factoring problem essentially remains the same \cite{343485}. For the elliptic curve discrete logarithm, specialized algorithms like index calculus cannot be applied which results in better security and smaller key sizes. The \emph{National Institute of Standards and Technology} (NIST) lists key sizes with comparable security for symmetric, $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ and elliptic curve asymmetric cryptography, which is shown in Table \ref{eqks}.

\begin{table}
% use packages: array
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
Symmetric key size & $\mathbb{Z}_{n}^{*}$ public key size & Elliptic Curve public key size \\ \cline{1-3}
80 bit & 1024 bit & 160 bit \\ 
112 bit & 2048 bit & 224 bit \\ 
128 bit & 3072 bit & 256 bit \\ 
192 bit & 7680 bit & 384 bit \\ 
256 bit & 15360 bit & 521 bit
\end{tabular}
\caption{Equivalent key sizes in bits, recommended by NIST}
\label{eqks}
\end{table}

As an example, today usual security from a RSA key size of 2048 bit can already be achieved with a 224 bit elliptic curve key.

\subsection{Elliptic Curve ElGamal}
\label{Elliptic Curve ElGamal}
The cryptosystem consists of a key generation algorithm based on the elliptic curve analogue of Diffie-Hellman, and an encryption and decryption algorithm based on the elliptic curve analogue of ElGamal.

\paragraph{Public Parameters} The parameters known to the public in advance are:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The elliptic curve $E$.
 \item A curve-point $P$, which generates a cyclic subgroup of $E$.
 \item The order $n$ of the cyclic subgroup of $E$.
\end{enumerate}
$P$ is a generator of the cyclic subgroup of $E$:
\begin{displaymath}
 \langle P\rangle=\{\infty,P,2P,3P,...,(n-1)P\}
\end{displaymath}


\paragraph{Key-pair Generation}
As input we give the public parameters from before. The procedure runs as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Choose $d\in_{u.a.r.}\{1,...,n-1\}$
 \item Compute $Q=dP$.
 \item Output pair $(Q,d)$. public key: $Q$, private key: $d$.
\end{enumerate}
We observe that computing the private key $d$ from a given public-key $Q$ requires solving the discrete logarithm problem.

\paragraph{Encryption}
Besides the public parameters, we are given the public-key $Q$. We want to encrypt a message $M$, which is encoded as a point on the elliptic curve (we elaborate how to do the encoding in the next section):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose $k\in_{u.a.r.}\{1,...,n-1\}$
\item Compute $C_1=kP$
\item Compute $C_2=M+kQ$
\item Output ciphertext: $(C_1,C_2)$
\end{enumerate}
One observation is that since $k$ is chosen at random, $C_2=M+kQ$ actually also appears to be random.

\paragraph{Decryption}
We are given the ciphertext-pair $(C_1,C_2)$, and the private key $d$. The goal is to reconstruct the message-point $M$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $C_2-dC_1=M+kQ-\underbrace{dkP}_{=k(dP)=kQ}=M$
\end{enumerate}
Note that for decryption, the curve order $n$ isn't actually needed. 

We now quickly want to investigate the number of elliptic curve operations each of the procedures require. The analysis is illustrated in Table \ref{elgoperations}.
We observe that decryption needs one multiplication compared to two in decryption. The results of our implementation show that the time needed for encryption is almost twice of decryption. It can be concluded that multiplication is the dominating operation compared to addition.

\subsection{Message Encoding}
\label{Message Encoding}
The only remaining question is how text messages could be encoded, or hashed onto points on the elliptic curve. For practical purposes, we restricted our implementation to ASCII text, where each character is represented as one byte code. This doesn't mean a loss of generality since arbitrary files can be encoded as ASCII text (for example by using \emph{base64}, which is used for e-mail attachments).

Since the size of the bit representation of elliptic curve points is restricted by the curve's modulus, messages have to be split in blocks. For example points on a 163 bit curve offer space for at most $\lfloor\frac{163}{8}\rfloor=20$ characters.

The basic idea of the encoding is that the message corresponds to the x-coordinate. Finding the corresponding y-coordinate requires computing a square-root in the prime case and solving a quadratic equation in the binary case. Now we know that only every second x-coordinate corresponds to a valid point and that if the point is valid, two y-coordinates exist. While we can select one of the tow y-coordinates simply at random, we have to ensure that the point is actually valid. This is done by adding some random padding to the coordinate, as long until the point is valid.

The method is summarized as follows ($m$ is the message we want to encode and the elliptic curve points offer space for $l$ characters):
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Split $m$ in blocks $m_i$ of size at most $l-1$ bytes.
 \item For each $m_i$: Choose a random byte $r$.
 \item Set $ASCII(m_i)|r$ as x-coordinate, and find the corresponding y-coordinate.
 \item If there are two y-coordinates: select one at random and output $(x,y)$. Otherwise if no y-coordinate exists, choose another padding $r$ and go back to point 3.
\end{enumerate}
We note that using 8 bit padding, the probability not to find a valid point is negligible ($2^{-256}$).


\section{Random Elliptic Curve Generation}
\subsection{Introduction}
The usage of predefined elliptic curves has its advantages and disadvantages. On one side there exist a set of curves recommended by NIST, which are publicly available in \emph{FIPS 186-3}.
Contained in the document are both curves over prime and binary fields with bit-sizes ranging from about 160 bits to about 500 bits. Those curves meet some security requirements and are especially suited for efficient implementations.
When it comes to elliptic curve cryptography it is probably the straightforward way to use the well-known NIST-recommended curves. Test-benches are available and the additional task to generate a curve is obsolete.

On the other side, there are not many reasons why not to use a new random curve for each key-agreement, given that the curves meet the same security properties than predefined curves.
The main advantage is obvious: when the curve is not known in advance, no precomputation can be done on it that might compromise its security. As an illustrative result, \cite{fixed} claims the security when using a random curve is the same as using a fixed curve with an 11 bit longer key.
The critical factor however is efficiency. Generating a random curve needs costly operations, and the process should not take much longer than a few seconds on modern hardware to be feasible in practice.

\subsubsection{Basic Approaches}
In the prime case, a curve is given by the equation
\begin{displaymath}
 y^2=x^3+a_px+b_p
\end{displaymath}
and in the binary case by
\begin{displaymath}
 y^2+x=x^3+a_bx^2+b_b.
\end{displaymath}
The task is in both cases to select the parameters $a$ and $b$ randomly, while the field modulus, or the reduction polynomial are given, respectively. In practice, the parameter $a$ could also be fixed in advance without much loss of generality, for instance to $a_p=-3$ and $a_b=0$ in order to enable using efficient EC arithmetic.

Just selecting random coefficients would be easy and efficient, but the major concern is that also the curve order has to be known in order to use a cryptosystem. There are two conceptually different approaches how to deal with the order while generating the curve, the \emph{random approach} and the \emph{complex multiplication approach}

\paragraph{Random Approach}
The random approach consists of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Select the curve coefficients at random.
 \item Compute the curve order, using a \emph{point counting} algorithm.
 \item If the curve doesn't meet the security requirements, start again with step 1.
\end{enumerate}


Using the point counting in each iteration would significantly influence the efficiency of the random approach. Instead, one can use an \emph{early-abort strategy} as described in \cite{satohfgh} that detects insecure curves quickly without the need to first compute their exact order. We will not further investigate this strategy but the results show that the point counting algorithm is clearly the dominating part of the random approach. We therefore only implement the point counting algorithm when we evaluate the random approach.

\paragraph{Complex Multiplication Approach}
The complex multiplication approach solves the curve generation from the other side: the conceptual idea is instead of computing the order for a purely random curve to define an order in advance and generate a matching curve to it.
The advantage of this method is that no point-counting algorithm has to run, which generally results in a better performance than in the random approach. The disadvantage however is that the curve is not entirely random.

The trade-off in selecting one of the two methods lies in efficiency versus randomness. If the latter is not of a big concern, one could use complex multiplication, while the random approach becomes more interesting the more efficient point-counting algorithms get.

\subsubsection{Security Requirements}
There are two main security requirements for elliptic curves as described in \cite{buchmann}. They have to be checked by the generation methods. The first one ensures that the order is large enough (at least about 160 bits), to avoid the usage of generic discrete logarithm algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $|E|=k\cdot r$, $r\geq 160$, $k\leq 4$
\end{itemize}
There are more specific attacks where the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem is transferred to the ordinary DL problem over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We don't go into details here, but the resulting requirement for a prime curve (over $\mathbb{F}_p$) is:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $p^s\not\equiv 1$ mod $r$, for $s\in\{1,..,20\}$, and $p\neq r$
\end{itemize}
and the corresponding requirement for binary curves over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ is:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $2^{ns}\not\equiv 1$ mod $r$, for $s\in\{1,..,20\}$, and $n$ prime
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The Prime Field Case}
\subsubsection{Complex Multiplication}
For $K=\mathbb{F}_p$, $p$ a given large prime, there is a polynomial time algorithm of Schoof for computing the number of points on a given curve.
However, it is quite slow in practice (the basic running time is $O(\log ^8p)$, although improvements were made) and quite complicated to implement.
Therefore we have used a different approach - first we decide on the desired order of the curve and the value of $p$, and afterward we generate a
curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$ with that order. The method we use is referred to as the \emph{Complex Multiplication} method. The theory of complex
multiplication is quite deep; we present here a brief overview of the facts related to the method.

Given an elliptic curve $E$ over some field $K$, we consider the set of \emph{endomorphisms} of $E$ (an homomorphism from $E$ to itself). There are
always ''trivial`` endomorphisms $\varphi_m$ defined by $\varphi_m(P)=m\cdot P=P+P+\dots+P$, and it's easy to see that endomorphisms form a ring
with induced addition (i.e. $(\varphi+\psi)(P)=\varphi(P)+\psi(P)$) and composition serving as multiplication, and that the ''trivial'' endomorphisms form a subring
isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. If the curve possess more endomorphisms, it is said to have possess complex multiplication. The name stems from
the fact that in this case the ring of endomorphisms is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}\tau+\mathbb{Z}$ with $\tau = (D+\sqrt{D})/2$ for some $D<0$
such that $D\equiv 0,1 (\mathrm{mod }4)$, i.e. the ring of endomorphisms is contained in a quadratic imaginary field. The value $D$ is called the \emph{discriminant} of the
endomorphisms ring, and the isomorphic ring is denoted by $\mathcal{O}_D$.

The usefulness of complex multiplication for our goals comes from the following fact: if $E$ is an elliptic curve possessing complex multiplication over $\mathbb{Q}$
with discriminant $D$, we can effectively calculate the order of $E$ over almost any field $\mathbb{F}_p$, problems arising only in cases where $p$ divides $D$ or
when the equation of $E$ does not define a proper elliptic curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$ (because the curve is not smooth). These cases are rare and
pose no real problem.

Recall that the order of any curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$ is $p+1+a_p$, with $|a_p|\le2\sqrt{p}$, so the challenge lies in computing $a_p$. If $D$ is
a quadratic residue over $p$, we have $a_p=\pi+\overline{\pi}$, with $\pi$ being an element of $\mathcal{O}_D$ such that $\pi\overline{\pi}=p$.
$\pi$ can be denoted $\frac{a+b\sqrt{D}}{2}$ , and so $\overline{\pi}=\frac{a-b\sqrt{D}}{2}$ (recall that $D<0$ so $\sqrt{D}$ is imaginary),
and so $p=\pi\overline{\pi}=\frac{a^2+|D|b^2}{4}$, or $4p=a^2+|D|b^2$, and  $a_p=\pi+\overline{\pi}=\frac{a+b\sqrt{D}+(a-b\sqrt{D}}{2}=a$.

Hence, if $D$ and $p$ are already known, to compute the order of the curve one needs only to solve the equation $a^2+|D|b^2=4p$. However, this equation
has two solutions (for $a$) which differ by sign, and so we get two different candidates for the order of the curve. A practical solution to this problem, which
we have implemented, is to take a random point $P$ on the curve and raise it to the power of each of the candidates, expecting to get $\mathcal{O}$ only
once. This proved to be an efficient and reliable solution.

Two questions remain: First, how to solve the equation $a^2+b^2|D|=4p$; and second, how to find a curve $E$ possing complex multiplication for
a given $D$?

\subsubsection{Cornacchia's Algorithm}
The first problem touches upon a well-known problem in mathematics - when is there a solution to the equation $x^2+ny^2=p$ with $p$ prime and
$n$ a natural number, and how can such a solution be found? The origins of the question can be traced to Fermat who gave the complete classification of
$p$ having solution for $n=1,2,3$. The proof of Fermat's results was first given by Euler, and it is connected strongly to the quadratic reciprocity theorem.
The general theory classifying $p$ for an arbitrary $n$ is quite deep and heavily relies on class field theory. However, there is a simple algorithm which
is essentially based on the Euclidean algorithm which always yields a solution if one exists.

The algorithm, due to Cornacchia, first determines whether $-n$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ and aborts if it is not (if $x^2+ny^2=p$ then $x^2=-ny^2$ modulo $p$,
i.e. $-n=\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^2$ modulo $p$). Next, a square root $x_0$ is found (i.e. $x_0^2=-d$ modulo $p$) - this requires an algorithm for square-root
extension modulo $p$ but in most cases it is quite easy and there is a standard probabilistic algorithm due to Shanks which deals with the only difficult case.
The next step is simply applying the Euclidean algorithm to the pair $(p,x_0)$ until a $b$ is obtained such that $b<\sqrt{p}$, and then the solution to the original equation
is $(x,y)=\left(b,\sqrt{\frac{p-b^2}{n}}\right)$ (if the square root does not exist, it is guaranteed there is no solution to the original equation).

We are dealing with a slightly different equation as on the right-hand side we have $4p$ instead of $p$. However, this requires only a slight change in
the algorithm - if we start the Euclidean algorithm with $(2p,x_0)$ and terminate it as soon as a value lower than $2\sqrt{p}$ is found, it is still guaranteed
to work unless no solution exists.

\subsubsection{The Hilbert Class Polynomials}
We turn now to the question of finding an elliptic curve possessing complex multiplication over $\mathbb{Q}$ for a given discriminant $D$. Given a
curve $E$ defined by the equation $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ its \emph{$j$-invariant} is defined as follows: $j_0=1728\frac{4a^3}{4a^3+27b^2}$ (the
constant 1728 is traditionally used for normalization purposes which we won't describe here). Over $\mathbb{Q}$ the j-invariant is unique for each
isomorphism class of curves; however, over $\mathbb{F}_p$, it is not. It is easy to see that for a curve given by $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ and any $c\in\mathbb{F}^*_p$,
the curve defined by $y^2=x^3+ac^2x+bc^3$ has the same j-invariant, but if $c$ is non-square, the new curve (termed \emph{the twist} of the original curve)
is not isomorphic to the original (if $c$ is a square, we have a new curve that is isomorphic to the original). This is not a real problem, though: recall that we have said that there are two possible candidates for the order of
the generated curve; one of the candidates is the real order of the curve, and the other one is the order of its twist.

Given a $j_0\in\mathbb{F}_p$ value, it is not difficult to construct an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$ with $j_0$ as the j-invariant;
indeed, define $k=\frac{j_0}{1728-j_0}$, and define $E$ by the equation $y^2=x^3+3kx+2k$. Now, by direct computation of the j-invariant we see that:
$$1728\frac{4a^3}{4a^3+27b^2}=1728\frac{2^2\cdot 3^3k^3}{2^2\cdot 3^3k^3+3^3\cdot 2^2k^2}=\frac{1728}{1+k^{-1}}=
\frac{1728}{\frac{j_0+1728-j_0}{j_0}}=j_0$$
As required.

Based on the theory of complex multiplication (which is not possible to describe here in detail), a polynomial with integer coefficients, called the \emph{Hilbert Class Polynomial}
can be found for every value of discriminant $D$, such that if $j_0$ is a root of the polynomial (over $\mathbb{Q}$), the corresponding elliptic curve
possesses complex multiplication for $D$. As we are only interested in the j-invariant modulo $p$, it suffices to find a root to the Hilbert class polynomial
over $\mathbb{F}_p$ - a relatively simple and discrete process which does not involve issues of precision.

The Hilbert class polynomials are usually computed by generating their roots in $\mathbb{C}$ and multiplying accordingly. This is a costly process which
does involve precision issues. Therefore, an alternative approach is simply to rely on a large known list of the Hilbert class polynomials for small values of $D$. This
works very well in practice and does not compromise the safety of the curve (which relies on the size of $p$ and its order).

\subsubsection{Summary - Overview of The Full Method}
We now describe the exact algorithm used for generation of curves over $\mathbb{F}_p$ with a known order. There are two possible approaches, depending on one's goals.
One can start with a known $p$ and search for a suitable curve among the known values of $D$, or one can choose $D$ upfront and choose random values of $p$. Therefore we have
two ``initialization'' algorithms:

Version 1: Known $p$.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Choose some value of $D$.
 \item Apply Cornacchia's algorithm in order to find t,s such that $t^2+|D|s^2=4p$.
 \item Check that among the two order candidates, $u_1=p+1+t,u_2=p+1-t$ there is at least one with admissible factorization. Otherwise, go back to step 1.
\end{enumerate}

Version 2: Known $D$.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Randomly choose integers $s,t$. of the appropriate magnitude.
 \item Check that $p=\frac{t^2+|D|s^2}{4}$ is a prime integer (using the Miller-Rabin primality test, for example).
 \item Check that among the two order candidates, $u_1=p+1+t,u_2=p+1-t$ there is at least one with admissible factorization. Otherwise, go back to step 1.
\end{enumerate}

The rest of the algorithm is the same no matter which initialization method was chosen:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Calculate (or find from a given list) the Hilbert class polynomial $H_D$ corresponding to $D$.
 \item Find a root $j_0$ of $H_D$ in the field $\mathbb{F}_p$.
 \item Set $k=\frac{j_0}{1728-j_0}$ modulo $p$.
 \item Set the resulting curve to be the one defined by $a=3kc^2,b=2kc^3$ for a random $c\in\mathbb{F}_p$
 \item Check which of the two possible candidates is the order of the curve. If it has an admissible factorization, return the curve; otherwise,
	  return the twist of the curve (i.e. pick randomly a non-square $e\in\mathbb{F}_p$ and return the curve $y^2=x^3+ae^2+be^3$.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{The Binary Field Case}
The complex multiplication method for generating a random curve can also be applied for the binary field case $K=\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$, where $n$ is prime.
In contrast to the prime field case, more efficient point counting algorithms for elliptic curves over fields of small characteristic exist.
Besides Schoof's algorithm, which is also applicable in the binary case, the more efficient variants are so-called \emph{p-adic} algorithms that require a special kind of arithmetic.
The most noticeable among them are the \emph{Satoh-FGH} algorithm \cite{satohfgh}, the Elliptic Curve \emph{AGM} algorithm \cite{717152}\cite{handbook}, and the \emph{SST} algorithm \cite{Satoh200389}.
The first two have an asymptotic complexity of $O(n^{3+\epsilon})$ and SST has a complexity of $O(n^{2.5+\epsilon})$, where the $\epsilon$ depends on the implementation of basic big integer arithmetic.

Despite the theoretic advantage of SST, AGM has found to be the best choice so far for practical implementations, which is the reason why we selected it for this project.

Arithmetic Geometric Mean (AGM) is a mixture of the arithmetic mean (the average of two numbers) and the geometric mean (the square root of the product of two numbers). If we have two natural numbers $a$ and $b$, we define the following sequence.
\begin{displaymath}
 a_0:=a,b_0:=b,a_{n+1}=\frac{1}{2}(a_n+b_n),b_{n+1}=\sqrt{a_nb_n}
\end{displaymath}
Gauss and Legendre originally discovered that the two sequences converge after a few iterations, so the AGM is defined as their limes:
\begin{displaymath}
 AGM(a,b):=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} a_n=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} b_n
\end{displaymath}
A traditional extension of AGM was found by Brent and Salamin, and can be used to compute the digits of $\pi$. The iteration is in this case defined as $AGM(1,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$. When $s_n=s_{n-1}-2^n(a_n^2+b_n^2)$, $p_n=\frac{2a_n^2}{s_n}$ converges to $\pi$.

Applied to elliptic curves, AGM can be used to compute the \emph{trace} of an elliptic curve, from which the order can easily be derived. In this section we don't give a full algebraic explanation of how AGM is used to recover the trace of the curve, and we refer to \cite{handbook} which provides an in-depth derivation. We rather concentrate on implementation related aspects. One is the use of \emph{2-adic} polynomials for the initialization of AGM.

\subsubsection{2-adic Arithmetic}
For practical purposes we present 2-adic arithmetic based on binary field arithmetic. There we have a binary extension field $\mathbb{F}_{2^d}\cong \mathbb{F}_2(\theta)/m(\theta)$, where the elements are polynomials up to degree $d$ with binary coefficients. The field operation is modulus an irreducible polynomial $m(\theta)$. 2-adic integers can be imagined like the binary representation of natural numbers, and can be represented by a unique fraction of two natural numbers. The approximations of those fractions form a ring structure. Formally, $\mathbb{Z}_{2^d}$ is the valuation ring of an unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_2$. Those elements are approximated up to a \emph{precision} $N$, and are taken modulus a polynomial $M(T)$: $\mathbb{Z}_{2^d}\cong \mathbb{Z}_2(T)/M(T)$.

The elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^d}/2^N\mathbb{Z}_{2^d}$ are polynomials of degree $d$, with coefficients modulus $2^N$. To come back to the connection with binary fields, elements in $\mathbb{F}_{2^d}$ can be \emph{lifted} to $\mathbb{Z}_{2^d}$. The lift is not unique: the coefficients must be congruent modulus $2$. For example, for $c=1+\theta^4\in \mathbb{F}_{2}(\theta)$ both $c_1'=1+T^4\in\mathbb{Z}_{2}(T)$ and $c_2'=1+2T^2+3T^4\in\mathbb{Z}_{2}(T)$ are valid lifts to precision at least $2$.

For the arithmetic over 2-adic polynomials (approximated to precision $N$), no programming libraries exist that provide the operations out of the box. The following operations are required for AGM:

\paragraph{Addition}
The coefficients of the polynomials are added and taken modulus $2^N$. No modular reduction is required here as the resulting polynomial doesn't exceed the maximum degree $d$.
\paragraph{Multiplication}
Requires a polynomial multiplication, followed by a reduction modulus $M(T)$. The coefficients are always taken modulo $2^N$.
\paragraph{Modular Reduction}
All operations that result in a polynomial of a higher degree than $d$ require a modular reduction.
\paragraph{Inverse}
The inverse of an element $a$ is computed as the root of the polynomial $f(X)=1-aX$. For this purpose a \emph{Newton iteration} is run $N$ times, so that the result has precision $N$. The initial approximation to precision $1$ is actually the inverse over binary fields, which is well known. The inverse is used for instance of polynomial division.
\paragraph{Square root}
For computing the square root, the inverse of the inverse square is taken. The inverse square root is computed as the root of the polynomial $f(X)=1-aX^2$. This is computed using a Newton iteration. As initial approximation of precision $1$, the  binary field square root must be implemented.

From those operations, we have have found multiplication and reduction to be the major bottleneck in the implementation. Polynomial multiplication can be highly optimized for example by using Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). This is the point where our approach ``building everything from scratch'' has certain limitations since highly optimized libraries exist especially for this purpose. We therefore also used polynomial multiplication from the \emph{NTL} library besides our own implementation.

\subsubsection{Elliptic Curve AGM}
The AGM iteration consists of two parts. The first is computing starting values $a_0$ and $b_0$ to full working precision $N=\lceil\frac{d}{2}\rceil+3$. The second part consists of $d$ AGM iterations in precision $N$.

The input elliptic curve has the form $y^2+x=x^3+b$. The output of the algorithm is the trace $t$, from which the order can be reconstructed as $2^d+1-t$. The order of the \emph{twisted} curve given by $y^2+x=x^3+x^2+b$ is $2^d+1+t$.

Summarized, the steps in the algorithm involve (see also \cite{handbook}):
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Lift $c$ to an arbitrary $c'$ of precision $4$.
 \item Initialize $a=1$ and $b=1+8c'$
 \item for $i=5..N$: $(a,b)=(\frac{a+b}{2},\sqrt{ab})$ (computation to precision $i$)
 \item set $a_0=a$
 \item for $i=1..d$: $(a_i,b_i)=(\frac{a_{i-1}+b_{i-1}}{2},\sqrt{a_{i-1}b_{i-1}})$ (computation to precision $N$)
 \item set $t=\frac{a_0}{a_d}$ (to precision $N-1$)
 \item if $t^2>2^{d+2}$: $t=t-2^{N-1}$
 \item return the trace: $t$.
\end{enumerate}

As an example we define $d=7$, the binary reduction polynomial $1+\theta+\theta^7$ and a coefficient $b=1+\theta^2+\theta^6$. As intermediate results of the algorithm we get 
\begin{displaymath}a_0=29+12T+16T^2+20T^3+24T^4+8T^5+28T^6\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}a_d=9+60T+16T^2+4T^3+56T^4+40T^5+44T^6\end{displaymath}.
Before step 7, $t=56$. It gets $t=t-2^{N-1}=-11$ afterwards. The elliptic curve order is therefore $2^7+1-(-11)=140$ points. The result can be verified by multiplying an arbitrary point times 140, and the result should be (and indeed is) the point at infinity ($0$).

\section{Implementation}
In this section we describe the various components implemented by us in the project.
\subsection{Prime field algorithms}
We have implemented a wrapper class for elements of $\mathbb{F}_p$ (zp\_int), complete with arithmetic and comparison operators, as
well as standard and Jacobian coordinate classes. We have also implemented a class for polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$ (ModularPolynomial) - again, complete with arithmetic (including GCD).

Most of the algorithms we have used are described in Henri Cohen's book~\cite{Co96}; we give the page numbers.

We have implemented the algorithm of Tonelli and Shanks for computing square roots over $\mathbb{F}_p$ (pg. 33), and used 
it to implement an algorithm for finding roots of general polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$ (pg. 37) needed in the complex multiplication
method in order to find roots of the Hilbert class polynomial. These algorithms require the computation of Legendre's symbol
and so we have implemented the standard efficient algorithm which utilizes the quadratic reciprocity theorem (pg. 29 gives an extended version).
We have also implemented Cornacchia's algorithm for finding $x,y$ such that $x^2+|D|y^2=4p$ for given $p,D$ (pg. 35).
Primality testing was done via GMP's library (which implements Miller-Rabin). 

\subsection{Binary field algorithms}
We have implemented binary finite field arithmetic in the class \emph{GFE.h} as two variants. The first one ``from scratch'', with algorithms for addition, multiplication (\cite{715867}), the extended euclidean algorithm for binary finite fields in order to compute the multiplicative inverse, and an algorithm for solving quadratic equations over $\mathbb{F}_{2^d}$ (see section \ref{binquadeq}). The last algorithm is especially of use in solving the curve-equation ($y^2+xy=x^3+ax^2+b$) to the y-coordinate. The second variant is actually a wrapper around the same functions provided by the NTL library. For the evaluations however we used in the implementation from scratch. The implementation was done in a way that GFE objects can be used the same way as ``primitive'' types, with the corresponding operators.

The algorithms used for AGM point-counting are defined in \emph{adicops.h}. This contains the AGM algorithm itself, as defined in the Book ``Handbook of Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography'' by Cohen and Frey \cite{handbook} at page 439. The p-adic algorithms required for AGM are: square-root computation, inverse square-root computation and inverse element computation. These algorithms are described in chapter 12 of the same book. In addition to this, p-adic polynomial-arithmetic containing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (all operations modulo an irreducible polynomial) was implemented in two variants: the first one from scratch in the wrapper class defined in \emph{Poly.h}. The second variant used modular polynomials from NTL and is defined in the wrapper class in \emph{ModPoly.h}.

\subsection{Elliptic curve implementation}
The implementation of elliptic curves had to be done in such a way that a caller that wants to use its arithmetic doesn't have to distinguish between prime and binary curves. This was achieved by using a stable interface class defined in \emph{Ellipticcurve.h}, which defines the following virtual functions:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Point addition
 \item Point subtraction
 \item Point doubling
 \item Point multiplication
 \item Get a point from the ``compressed format'' (see section \ref{Compressed format}).
 \item Convert a point to the ``compressed format'' (section \ref{Compressed format}).
 \item Get a random point on the curve (see section \ref{Finding a random point on the curve}).
\end{itemize}

The concrete implementation of the functions are done in \emph{ECPrime.h} for prime curves and \emph{ECBinary.h} for binary curves. In this way, the program can deal with objects of abstract type \emph{Ellipticcurve} without having to know the underlying implementation. The predefined NIST-curves are all implemented as own subclasses of ECBinary or ECPrime, which simplifies the initialization of those curves. In this case an Ellipticcurve object is simply initialized with the concrete \emph{CurveNISTp192} implementation, representing the prime NIST curve over 192 bit.

Elliptic curve arithmetic, namely addition and multiplication was implemented according to Menezes' book ``Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography'' \cite{940321}, pg. 81,97.

\subsubsection{Finding a random point on the curve}
\label{Finding a random point on the curve}
Another algorithm which is implementation specific is finding a random point on the curve. This is required while generating a random curve suitable for the cryptosystem.

Both algorithms for prime and binary curves choose a random x coordinate until a corresponding y coordinate exists. For prime curves $y^2=x^3+ax+b$, this requires computing a modular square root, and in the binary case for curves $y^2+xy=x^3+ax^2+b$, a binary quadratic equation must be solved.

\subsubsection{Compressed format}
\label{Compressed format}
Because we are able to find the y-coordinate for a given x, the full definition of y is actually redundant information. Since there are two solutions for x, the question is only which one was intended.

For the purpose of storing and recovering points from text-files (as described in section \ref{ecdefinitions}), we use the \emph{compressed format}. This consists of the x-coordinate, preceeded by either ``+'' or ``-'' at the beginning, indicating which of the possible y-coordinates has to be chosen. As an example,
\begin{verbatim}
 -6468585198793925939445065556022715668330587295808
\end{verbatim}
is a valid point in compressed format for the 163 bit binary NIST curve.

The algorithms we implemented for compression and decompression are defined in \cite{point-compress}, section E.2.3.1 (compression) and in \cite{point-decompress}, section A.12.8/9 (decompression).

\subsection{Cryptosystem implementation}
The elliptic curve ElGamal cryptosystem is implemented in the class defined in \emph{elgamal.h}. To the cryptosystem, an ``Ellipticcurve'' object must be passed which is used for the elliptic curve operations. ECC ElGamal consists of the following functionality:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Plaintext encryption
 \item Ciphertext decryption
 \item Random key-pair generation
\end{itemize}

For the corresponding algorithms, see section \ref{Elliptic Curve ElGamal}. In addition to this, routines for encoding strings to a point on an elliptic curve (including random padding) and for decoding string from points are implemented (for details, see section \ref{Message Encoding}). Furthermore, a curve validation function is implemented, which multiplies the curve-point with the curve-order. In a correctly defined curve, the result should be the point at infinity.

\subsection{Command-line interface}
The command-line interface, used for interpreting the user's parameters is implemented in \emph{cmd.h}. It parses the switches provided over the command-line, and launches actions like key-pair generation, encryption or decryption accordingly. A guide how to use the interface is given in chapter \ref{User Guide}.

\subsection{Metrics}
The implementation is done in C++ and consists of approximately 7500 lines of code. The code is distributed in 29 files, containing 34 classes. In total, 53 test-cases are written (using CppUnit) and can be executed at any time.

\section{Results}
In this section we present some measurements and some highlighted results regarding our implementation. First, the key generation timings with different key sizes for both prime and binary curves are analyzed in \ref{keygenres}. In \ref{encdecres}, we measure the timings for encryption and decryption, and in \ref{agmres} we measure the efficiency of the AGM point-counting algorithm. The measurements were done on an Intel Core Duo processor with 1.8 GHz.

\subsection{Key Generation}
The key-pair generation was run with the built-in NIST curves over prime and binary fields. The key sizes are 192, 224, 256, 384 and 521 bits for prime curves and 163, 283, 409 and 571 bits for binary curves. The results are shown in Figure \ref{figure:keygen}.

\label{keygenres}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{keygen.png}
\caption{Key-pair generation, with prime and binary curves.}
\label{figure:keygen}
\end{figure}

As expected, the time increases about linearly with the key size, while the slope in prime curve is slightly higher than in binary curves.. The operation done is essentially one elliptic curve point multiplication. The timings for all tested curves don't exceed one second and are therefore feasible. The computation in prime curve show a significant advantage over the binary curves. The difference most likely comes from the fact that the binary curve arithmetic uses binary field arithmetic built from scratch while prime field arithmetic was done using GMP. For a definite result, more optimized binary field arithmetic should be used.

\subsection{Encryption and Decryption}
While in the key-generation test the processed data depends on the key-size, in the encryption and decryption test all cases process a file of the same size: 3.3KB. Because a curve with double key size can store the double amount of information on one point, larger key sizes have the theoretical advantage that less ciphertext-points are produced and therefore less operations are done. The results are illustrated in Figure \ref{figure:encdec}.

\label{encdecres}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{dia2.png}
\caption{Encryption/Decryption results on a 3.3KB file. Top: prime curves. Bottom: binary curves.}
\label{figure:encdec}
\end{figure}

The first thing we observe is that encryption takes approximately twice as much time as decryption. This is explained with the fact that encryption requires two multiplication while decryption needs only one (see Table \ref{elgoperations}). We again see a significant advantage of the prime curves, like in curve generation. Furthermore it can be observed that the efficiency of smaller keys is better than of larger keys, even though the total number of processed blocks is higher. The slopes of the measurement curves is however steeper in key-generation.

As a general comment, public-key cryptography is in practice not very often used for actual encryption because of its inferior performance compared to symmetric key cryptography. Instead, it is usually used to establish a symmetric key and the actual encryption is done for example with AES. We can also see in our results that the efficiency of our implementation is not sufficient to encrypt large files in a reasonable time.

\subsection{Point Counting with AGM}
The first attempt with the AGM algorithm was an implementation of the underlying polynomial multiplication and reduction ``from scratch''. This was identified as the clear bottleneck as the runtime for a key-size of ~300 bits was about 30 minutes. We therefore decided to replace those operations with the ones provided by the NTL library, which resulted in a dramatic performance improvement: the runtime for the same key-size was reduced to only a few seconds. The results are illustrated in Figure \ref{figure:agm}.

\label{agmres}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{dia1.png}
\caption{AGM point counting with varied key sizes.}
\label{figure:agm}
\end{figure}

The initial goal to be able to generate random curves in only a few seconds is attained, looking at the results for key sizes up to about 500 bits. As an additional step for curve generation, an early-abort strategy to skip insecure curves \cite{satohfgh} would be needed. As described in the reference, a single point counting run dominates the early-abort step, from which we can conclude the feasibility of the random curve generation approach with AGM.

\subsection{Challenge Solution}
For testing the correctness of the implementation we were given a test consisting of the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Generating an elliptic curve over prime field.
 \item Decrypting two messages over prime field.
 \item Decrypting two messages over binary field.
 \item Deciding which message was forged.
\end{itemize}

In the first task, we were given the prime field modulus and some information needed to generate a curve using the complex multiplication method. The modulo equals the 13th Mersenne prime ($n=2^{521}-1$), the imaginary field discriminant for complex multiplication is $D>-400$ and the EC parameter $a=-3$. 
An additional security constraint was imposed on the curve - its order had largest prime divisor $>2^{160}$ and the rest of the prime divisors were $<2^{16}$. 
The original description is available in Appendix \ref{appendixa}.

These constraints admit a unique ``solution'', i.e. a suitable curve. In order to find it we generated using the CM methods all the possible
curves over $\mathbb{F}_p$ for our specific $p$ and the possible values of $D$ (i.e. $D>-400$), except for those values of
$D$ for which there is no solution to the equation $x^2+|D|y^2=4p$ (i.e. Cornacchia's algorithm fails on them). Not all those curves
were isomorphic to curves with $a=-3$, and so they were also discarded. For the remaining curve, their order was known as a result
of the CM method and among them all, only one curve had order satisfying the security constraints (for $D=-139$).

Finally the private key definition, readable by our implementation for the first curve was (for the format, see section \ref{ecdefinitions}):

\begin{verbatim}

The decrypted first ciphertext was (without new lines):

\end{verbatim}

So there was a second layer in the challenge, which consists of full definitions of two binary curves and two ciphertexts. The curve order isn't included, but this isn't necessary information for decryption. The reduction polynomial can be read from a table in \cite{940321} and is $z^{283}+z^{12}+z^7+z^5+1$. The first curve is defined as
\begin{displaymath}
 y^2 + xy = x^3 + x^2 + 43fdf8a39baa3eaad2fc71f1329184399a63e6fc51239c3df5e8b9e9de57618887eee7c
\end{displaymath}
and the second as 
\begin{displaymath}
 y^2 + xy = x^3 + 7cb16923a86f239ccb3d1cd7bd4d3de5dc3b97eda43330f533da57d8c208701899724dd
\end{displaymath}

After bringing this information in the format readable for our application, the ciphertext was decrypted. The first message was:

\begin{verbatim}
 Class number for discriminant -877991 equals 818.
\end{verbatim}

The decrypted second message was:

\begin{verbatim}
 Class number for discriminant -1293367 equals 513.
\end{verbatim}

The class number is a well-known invariant in Algebraic Number Theory and can be computed using standard algebra libraries. Using the sage library, it was found that the first solution is true while the other is false (the class number in the second case is 511). Hence, the second message was forged.

\section{User Guide}
\label{User Guide}
This section is intended to provide information to the interested user who wants to experiment with our application.
With the command line interface, our program provides a convenient way to use elliptic curve cryptography in practice. The functions and how they are used is presented, along with some practical examples.

\subsection{Getting the Source}
The program source itself can be downloaded over one of the two identical repositories: \url{http://github.com/gadial/ECC} and \url{http://github.com/bhess/ECC}. One can also use \emph{git} to download the source:
\begin{verbatim}
 #> git clone git://github.com/gadial/ECC.git
\end{verbatim}
Once the repository is cloned, the source can be actualized with
\begin{verbatim}
 #> git pull
\end{verbatim}
\emph{git} itself is available under \url{http://git-scm.com}.

\subsection{Compiling the Source}
The source repository provides a makefile, so that the source is compiled by running
\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> make
\end{verbatim}
in the root folder of the repository.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
In order to successfully compile the source, some shared libraries should be installed. We recommend to install current versions of the following libraries (in braces are tested versions):

\begin{itemize}
 \item CppUnit (version 1.12.0) \url{http://cppunit.sourceforge.net}
 \item GMP - GNU Multi-Precision Library (version 4.3.1) \url{http://gmplib.org}
 \item NTL (version 5.5.2) \url{http://www.shoup.net/ntl}
\end{itemize}

The program is tested under 32 bit Linux. As compiler we used g++ version 4.4.1.

\subsection{Elliptic Curve Definitions}
\label{ecdefinitions}
Public-key and private-keys contain the full definition of the corresponding elliptic curve. The files must be provided to the application in order to do encryption and decryption. A sample public-key or private-key file has the following structure:

\begin{itemize}
 \item 1. line: ``prime'' or ``binary'' curve.
 \item 2. line: Elliptic curve modulus (prime) or reduction polynomial (binary)
 \item 3. line: Parameter $a$.
 \item 4. line: Parameter $b$.
 \item 5. line: Point $P$ on the elliptic curve, in compressed form.
 \item 6. line: Elliptic curve order.
 \item 7. line: Public key (in compressed form) or private key.
\end{itemize}

All values must be decimal. A sample public key definition for a prime curve could looks the following way:

\begin{verbatim}
prime

\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Command Line Interface}
Over a simple command line interface, the following three functions of the cryptosystem can be used:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Key-pair generation.
 \item Encryption
 \item Decryption
\end{itemize}

When the executable is run without switch, the usage parameters are displayed:

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> ./ECC
Usage:
ECC {-pk </path/to/pk> -enc </path/to/plaintext> |
     -sk </path/to/sk> -dec </path/to/ciphertext> |
     -gen_key {-ec_name 'name' | -use_ec </path/to/ec>}
     -validate </path/to/ec>
Predefined Curves (NIST): [p192|p224|p256|p384|p521|b163|b283|b409|b571]
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Key-pair Generation}
By using the switch \emph{-gen\_key} we indicate that a public-key/private-key should be generated. For this purpose the elliptic curve has to be known. The 9 curves recommended by NIST are built-in and can be specified with the switch \emph{-ec\_name}. In the NIST curve names, 'p' indicates a prime curve and 'b' a binary curve; the number afterwards indicate their bit-size. If we want to generate a key-pair with the curve \emph{p192}, we run:

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> ./ECC -gen_key -ec_name p192
\end{verbatim}

Then two textfiles, containing the curve information and the keys are generated (the file-names contain a timestamp when the curve key has been generated):

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> cat public_key_201003220104.txt
prime
6277101735386680763835789423207666416083908700390324961279

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

The second possibility is to use a curve-definition from a file, with the \emph{-use\_ec} switch. In the next example, we take the above generated public-key file as definition of a curve.

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> ./ECC -gen_key -use_ec public_key_201003220104.txt
\end{verbatim}

And the following files are created:

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> cat public_key_201003220109.txt
prime

A function to generate a random curve directly over the command line is currently not available. For random curve generation, the program API has to be used directly.

\subsubsection{Encryption}
For encrypting textfiles, one needs to provide a public-key file which also contains the elliptic curve definition. Suppose we want to encrypt the file \emph{faust.txt}:

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> cat faust.txt
Habe nun ach! Philosophie, Juristerei und Medizin, und leider auch Theologie!
durchaus studiert mit heissem Bemuehn. Da steh ich nun, ich armer Tor! und bin so
klug als wie zuvor; heisse Magister, heisse Doktor gar, und ziehe schon an der zehen
Jahr herauf, herab und quer und krumm meine Schueler an der Nase herum - und sehe,
dass wir nichts wissen koennen! Das will mir schier das Herz verbrennen!
\end{verbatim}

We use the first public-key generated in the last section with the NIST curve p192 for encryption, and the command is:

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> ./ECC -pk public_key_201003220104.txt -enc faust.txt
\end{verbatim}

The name of the file containing the ciphertext is the plaintext-name with extension \emph{.enc}. The ciphertext point-pairs are written in compressed form and are separated line by line (in the following some contents were truncated for layout reasons):

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> cat faust.txt.enc
-2941418657115936641805...,+1926840320549465382934...

...
...
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Decryption}
Analogue to encryption, we provide the private key, containing the curve definition to the command line interface to decrypt a ciphertext. To decrypt the example from before, run the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> ./ECC -sk private_key_201003220104.txt -dec faust.txt.enc
\end{verbatim}

The decrypted file has the file-extension \emph{.dec}, and indeed, the decryption was successful!:

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> cat faust.txt.enc.dec
Habe nun ach! Philosophie, Juristerei und Medizin, und leider auch Theologie!
durchaus studiert mit heissem Bemuehn. Da steh ich nun, ich armer Tor! und bin so
klug als wie zuvor; heisse Magister, heisse Doktor gar, und ziehe schon an der zehen
Jahr herauf, herab und quer und krumm meine Schueler an der Nase herum - und sehe,
dass wir nichts wissen koennen! Das will mir schier das Herz verbrennen!
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Elliptic Curve Validation}
For elliptic curves defined in a text-file, the switch -validate provides a quick and handy function to validate that the provided parameters are correct. Beside curve definition files consisting of 6 lines, also private and public keys can be provided, where the last line defining the key is simply ignored.

Suppose we want to to validate the elliptic curve defined in the following public-key file:

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> cat ./challenge/private_key_binary1.txt
binary
15541351137805832567355695254588151253139254712417116170014499277911234281641667989665

+10744526979748405769424843092044115614633826679604470999470890953483892379364112110203
15541351137805832567355695254588151253139256032115589896844343002557484362928298853438
26334010226743190633240527195230292831833139108096019898661304553382794977231705
\end{verbatim}

To validate we run:

\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> ./ECC -validate ./challenge/private_key_binary1.txt
Validation succeeded!
\end{verbatim}

More specifically, the test reads in the EC parameters, decompresses the point on the curve and multiplies the point with the curve order. If the result is the point at infinity, the validation succeeds and otherwise it fails.

\subsubsection{Testcases}
The implementation has a large number of built-in test-cases that test different aspects of the implementation, like finite field arithmetic or several algorithms. With the switch -t the test-cases are launched:
\begin{verbatim}
 #ECC> ./ECC -t
 .....................................................

 OK (53)
\end{verbatim}
This is mainly for debugging purposes and shows that ``everything should be right'', especially after changes in the code are made.

\section{Conclusion}
In this project we investigated the large field of elliptic curve cryptography, whose properties enable to achieve the same security with much smaller key sizes compared to public key cryptography over $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$. We implemented an elliptic curve cryptosystem ``from scratch'', relying only on big integer arithmetic. This implied the implementation of finite field arithmetic and several additional algorithms. Furthermore, the implementation was done for both elliptic curves over prime and binary fields. Besides the deep insight this approach gave, also some limitations were shown, namely not all our implementation can compete with highly optimized libraries.

Besides the cryptosystem, we implemented two cutting-edge methods to generate random elliptic curves. The two approaches are conceptually different: the \emph{Complex Multiplication} (over prime fields) generates a curve for a given order, and the \emph{AGM} point-counting method (over binary fields) computes the order for given curve parameters. We showed the practical feasibility of both methods and that a random curve with not too large bit-size up to about 300 bits can be generated within a few seconds. We successfully solved a challenge consisting of generation of a prime curve, and decryption over a prime and a binary curve. 

Further work could involve the implementation of Complex Multiplication for binary fields and point-counting for prime fields, which would enable a direct comparison between binary and prime curves. Several optimizations could be done, either by choosing more efficient algorithms or by low-level optimizations. Additionally, a comparison of our implementations with variants from optimized library would be interesting. As cryptosystem, we choose the ECC ElGamal system for encryption and decryption. An additional task would be to implement a signature scheme, or to choose a different encryption system.

For end-users, the product of our project is an elliptic-curve-cryptosystem that is ready-to-use. One can either define own curves or choose between different predefined curves recommended by NIST. They can be used for key-generation, encryption and decryption of arbitrary text-messages. The implementation in C++ is done in a clean, easy-extensible object-oriented design, and achieves a high efficiency typical for native code. The entire project consists of approximately 7500 lines of code.
